**HighOrder_SComparison** is an R package for detecting differenital genes associated with phenotype from single cell profiles. This tool is developed and maintained by [Ken chen's lab](https://www.mdanderson.org/research/departments-labs-institutes/labs/ken-chen-laboratory.html) in MDACC. There is a pressing need for computatinal tools to enable the detection of genes associated with phenotypes in single-cell level. This task is very challening in single-cell studies due to the existence of: 1) changes in cell type composition among samples and 2) unknow technological batch effects. Our high-order single cell comparison method
