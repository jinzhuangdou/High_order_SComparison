**High_order_SComparsion** is an R package for detecting differenital genes in single cell profiles in high-order level.  i
  
  ntegration analysis, developed and maintained by [Ken chen's lab](https://sites.google.com/view/kchenlab/Home) in MDACC. `bindSC` is developed to address the challenge of single-cell multi-omic data integration that consists of unpaired cells measured with unmatched features across modalities. Previous methods such as [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/), [Liger](https://github.com/MacoskoLab/liger), [Harmony](https://github.com/immunogenomics/harmony) did not work on this case unless match feature empricallcy. For example, integration of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data requires to calculate the gene/promoter activity by counting peaks in gene body, which always loses information. This strategy also did not work on integrating scRNA-seq and cytof data becasue gene pression and protein abundance level is not always correlated due to sparsity of scRNA-seq data or post translational modification.
