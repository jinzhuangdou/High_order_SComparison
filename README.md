**HighOrder_SComparison** is an R package for detecting differenital genes associated with phenotype from single cell profiles. This tool is developed and maintained by [Ken chen's lab](https://sites.google.com/view/kchenlab/Home) in MDACC. There is a pressing need for computatinal tools to enable the detection of genes associated with phenotypes in single-cell level. This task is very challening because 
  
  
  
  Although there are many tools avaiable for detecting cell abundacne difference among single cell samples with different phenotypes, such as [miloR](https://github.com/MarioniLab/miloR) and [CNA](https://github.com/immunogenomics/cna), it is still challenging to identify genes associated with phenotypes.
